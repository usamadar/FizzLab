1. When user finishes an experiment, the "Try another experiment" button takes me back to the home screen but it is showing navigation to go back to Results. It should just go back to the home screen. 
2. Check if clicking on the steps in the experiment screen is working as expected. 
3. Add 7 more experiments to have atleast 10.
